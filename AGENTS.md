## Manifest Validation

After making any changes to `manifest.xml`, you **must** validate it to ensure it conforms to the schema.

Run the following command to validate the manifest:

```bash
npm run validate
```

If the validation fails, you must correct the `manifest.xml` file before submitting your changes.
